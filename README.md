The project located in the testing Website folder is a personal website with three sections, About, Portfolio, and Contact.

About is a brief introduction of myself, and the photos/Apps in the portfolio will be soon replaced by apps that are made by myself in the near future. I have additionally made a contact section for people who want to collaborate or hire me.
